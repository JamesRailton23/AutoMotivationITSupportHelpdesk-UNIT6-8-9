# AutoMotivationITSupportHelpdesk-UNIT6&8&9-FINAL

This GitHub repository contains the final software developed for the unit 6, 8, and 9 project to develop an IT helpdesk for AutoMotivation. The helpdesk consists of a ticketing system that enables users to report issues they are experiencing. Within the helpdesk, there is an account system that enables users to authenticate themselves as either a general employee, IT support technician, or a manager. This system also prevents unauthorised access, keeping the helpdesk secure. The website includes a ticketing system and account system.
